### A Three-Day Workshop at the University of Oxford

`PopAging DataViz—UK` is a three-day workshop on visualising population data within `R`—a powerful, open-source programming language for statistical computing and visualisation. Throughout the workshop, the [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) library will serve as our workhorse and lodestar. Over the course of three days, workshop participants will be exposed to many of the principles undergirding the [*grammar of graphics*]{style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: #324D6B;"} framework for visualising data in systematic fashion—a grammar that serves as the lifeblood of `ggplot2` and its many extensions.

Then, the course will slowly build in complexity. Concretely, participants will be exposed to modules on:

-   Constructing population pyramids and other plots that are germane to population research (e.g., Lexis diagrams).

-   Visualising geographic data to highlight the spatial foundations of social, political and demographic phenomena.

-   Using interactivity and animations to bring data visualisations to life.

-   Visualising statistical quantities of substantive interest (e.g., average marginal effects, counterfactual contrasts, adjusted predictions at representative values) to extract *meaning* from model results.

The workshop will draw on a wide range of packages and a series of hands-on exercises designed to concretise high-level concepts and principles related to data visualisation. All workshop materials are available—and will be maintained—on this repository and the course website.

### The Challenge

Contra previous iterations of `PopAging DataViz`, our short course will not culminate with a friendly ["Shark Tank"](https://popagingdataviz.com/shark_tank.html) competition. Instead, participants will be asked to (i) work in pairs; and (ii) produce simple—but elegant—visualisations in `R` with data that we provide. For more information, please click The Challenge tab.

### Sponsors

This short course is being co-hosted by the *Consortium on Analytics for Data-Driven Decision-Making* ([CAnD3](https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/)) and their partners at the [Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science](https://www.demography.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford.

CAnD3 is hosted at McGill University and supported in part by funding from the [Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx) (SSHRC).

### Inspirations

Cédric Scherer's course on [`Graphic Design with ggplot2`](https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/ggplot2-graphic-design/), Andrew Heiss' course on [`Data Visualization with R`](https://datavizf24.classes.andrewheiss.com/), and the third edition of [`ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis`](https://ggplot2-book.org/) all serve as inspirations for this three-day workshop.
